# CDC Data Architecture with OpenSource and Microsoft Fabric
*Real-time data Capturing*

# Introduction
As billions of data gets generated daily and having a robust system that can manage such an influx of data is of high importance. With OpenSource technology achieving such a process is possible but the question arises how can this be done also on an enterprise level for business users?
# Project Requirement
In company XYZ Limited your AppDev(Software Department) currently has a web application that sends to a PostgreSQL Database via a Connection String. As a senior data engineer for XYZ Limited, you have been tasked to create a CDC approach to connect to Azure PostgreSQL and capture the data in real life as they get inserted into the database and then stored in a NoSQL Database which will be Elasticsearch.

The Analytic Department uses Microsoft Power BI for reporting, and you also want to capture the same data of CDC in Microsoft using the Microsoft Fabric component available. The architecture below explains the entire process and what we aim to achieve.
